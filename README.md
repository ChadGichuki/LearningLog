# LearningLog

This is a Web app to journal about things I'm learning about. The entries are grouped into topics to make it easier to keep track of what I'm learning in various topics.
I deployed this on heroku (The free tier) to understand the process and have a feel of live projects.


Gratitude to Eric Matthes for his wonderful book: "Python Crash Course - A hands-on project -based introduction to programming"
